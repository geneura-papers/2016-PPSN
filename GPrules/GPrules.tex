\begin{abstract}
The growth in the number of personal devices in terms of variety and computational
abilities has given birth to a concept in the corporate world
known as ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD).
Corporations following this policy allow 
employees to bring to work and use their personal devices at
the company premises or while on company work. Despite the  significant advantages of this policy such as reducing
business cost and increasing work productivity, the access to internal network and the assets they hold by these personal devices, for which
enterprises have limitations in controlling, exposes the companies to
security threats such as leak of confidential data and access by
unauthorized users. % All this intro should be shorter and more to the point - JJ
To handle these kinds of threats, there
is a need for a way of detecting and controlling abnormal user
access by establishing a classification rules based policy. Thus, in
this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming (GP) based framework for
BYOD security. In this environment, GP is used as a promising approach
capable of performing an automatic discovery of novel and interesting
threat classification rules, with the additional feature of presenting the new rules in an easily understandable way.
The simulation results over real data and a
comparison with the results achieved by other techniques confirm the
viability, effectiveness, and applicability of the GP approach to the
BYOD security context.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The fast pace of new technology has led modern computing to undergo
several outstanding transitions in a short period of time. Modern computing has moved over time to smaller, more reliable and faster high-tech devices such as smartphones, laptops and tablets. The use of these technologies in several forms is progressing, and has led to the form of use known as the ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD) concept or philosophy. Since its first appearance in research \cite{ballagas2004byod} as a way to call the interaction between people's devices and a public display, such as art or advertising, it has become a very popular practise, integrated into companies \cite{thomson2012byod} and even schools \cite{song2014bring}. 

In the corporate world, the BYOD
practice refers to allowing employees to use their
personal laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices in
for work-related tasks, but not necessarily while being in the workplace This has many
advantages \cite{singh2012byod}; among them we mention saving costs --
as the company allows itself to save money on high-priced devices that
it would normally be required to purchase for their employees --, and
increasing flexibility and worker productivity as employees will not
be asked to haul around multiple devices to satisfy both their personal and
work needs, having everything they need in one device anytime and
anywhere. 
Other advantages are tied to the increase of worker satisfaction,  attracting the best applicants, and the increase of engagement in the workplace and after hours \cite{singh2012byod}. % references too - JJ
% (Paloma) All advantages come from the same paper, so I've repeated the reference.

%These advantages have made BYOD policies gain traction in the education
%sector with an increasing number of schools around the world choosing
%to implement their own BYOD policies. % reference!!! - JJ
% Also I don't see the point. Where do you want to bring this argument to? - JJ
% Ok, maybe we talk too much about BYOD at schools when we use company BYOD data, but it's true that schools are environments in which policies should be enforced too, right? Or can be applied in another way... So, what can we do? To create a section at the end called "other applications for our framework", for example? Or just mention it, reducing what's written now, and that's all?
%In such environment, BYOD (also called Bring Your Own Technology) refers to a technology model that
%allows students to bring their own devices to school for learning in
%the classroom \cite{sangani2013byod, song2014bring}. The adoption of BYOD in schools
%is supported by the fact that technology plays a leading role in
%pupils/students' everyday lives and should, therefore, be an integral
%part of their learning. However, for most schools it is financially
%unsustainable to provide every student with the most appropriate
%up-to-date device. BYOD is therefore considered an attractive,
%cost-effective alternative, provided that many students usually own
%devices that are superior and more up-to-date than those available in
%schools. BYOD at schools has several benefits as well such as
%personalising learning experiences, encouraging students' independent
%learning, and promoting anytime, anywhere learning opportunities. % and this is important to know because... - JJ

However, there exists a big disadvantage concerning security, as potentially unsecured devices from unawared users might interact with important assets. Therefore, the main issue is to obtain a high level of security, while maintining user privacy \cite{miller2012byod}.% if the issues are the same, why mention different environments separately? Besides, what assets of the learning center are you actually accessing? - JJ
Focusing on the corporate world and as previously highlighted, %my point exactly. Now you say we don't care about schools - JJ
% the BYOD paradigm has several advantages
%as it plays a leading role in increasing the
%companies benefits.  Despite of that this
%paradigm calls for a crucial need for securing company assets in the BYOD context. It is
it is clear that the uncontrolled access to internal networks by the
personal devices, for which companies have limitations in
controlling due to privacy preservation \cite{miller2012byod}, exposes the companies to security risks such as data
leakage, improper decommissioning, phishing including spear phishing, surveillance, and many
others \cite{lennon2012changing}. These threats have become the
companies main security concern, and for them it is a challenge to
assure a compromise between pushing personal devices towards
professional use and coping with their own stringent and complex
security requirements. This trend is inevitable as enterprises are
faced with questions of whether and how to manage this situation \cite{thomson2012byod}; and
thus every department must be involved in establishing security
policies and procedures to minimize the company's risks.

To this end, the Corporate Security Policies (CSPs),
defined by the company's Chief Security Officer (CSO), are the core at
identifying threats and building a set of security rules. The description of these jobs include protecting
company assets by defining permissions to be considered for every
different action to be performed inside or outside the company's work
space, and eventually coming from the employees personal devices. Nonetheless, the CSOs build the set of CSPs based on their expertise, and as such, they have the limitation of not knowing every possible combitation of events that might lead to a dangerous situation.

The aim of this paper is to propose a novel  BYOD security rules extraction technique that aids the CSO in the definition and refinement of a set of security rules. % The first claim about this paper can't be this imprecise. Say exactly what you want to do, not "going behond". Say that you will be helping define and refine those rules automatically, instead of having the CSO imagining and implementing, by herself, all the needed rules - JJ
% (Paloma) I agree, changed it, what do you think?
The main idea is to create a reliable rule set
which is able to cover every new situation that may be a threat;
allowing the system to go beyond the limited set of known pre-defined
rules. In order to have the space of possible policy rules be as wide as possible, we will need a techinque that explores the rule space efficiently and with as little structure as possible
% in order to have the space of possible policy rules be as wide as possible, we will need a techinque that explores the rule space efficiently and with as little structure as possible, that is why we introduce...
% You should say something like this. You need to motivate and justify the use of GP, mentioning previous work on the subject and how you really discovered that it was not enough - JJ
 This is why we introduce the use of Genetic Programming (GP), which
has been emerged as a promising approach to deal with the problem of
discovering novel and interesting knowledge and rules from large
amount of data. Our proposed GP framework dedicated
for the BYOD context is capable of performing an automatic discovery
of classification rules.
% Once again, there is a huge imbalance in the space and energy
% devoted to BYOD and the one you devote to GP. Except if you are
% going to publish in GPEM, which includes GP in the title, you will
% probably need to say a little bit more about GP. Even if it's GP,
% there are so many different ways if doing it that you will probably
% need to be more precise, specififying whether you mean "classic" GP
% or any other way. 

% This intro is very soft and does not have any "hard" claim. It does
% not really say what is specifically the problem we are dealing
% with, what we want to do and how it is addressing that
% problem. There should be a clear argumental line, something like 
% BYOD is very popular, but it presents security problems when you mix
% possibly compromised or unsecured devices with protected
% assets. Protecting that asset is the turf of the CSO, who defines
% security policies for asset access based on her expertise. However,
% these policies can't properly address the new threats posed by BYOD
% devices. That is why we need an automatic way of automatically
% defining these policies using known user actions and the possible
% threats they will eventually bring, especially when the action of an
% user might not result in immediate security danger, but in a
% possible future danger.
% I don't know, something like that, with more references, but with a
% clear argumental line. Without this argumental line, all the
% structure of the paper falls down in pieces. You can't create a
% proper state of the art, do the proper tests, and so on. - JJ

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:SotA} we give an overview of the advances in GP applied to rule evolution and its applications; then, Section \ref{sec:problem} depicts the problem this work tries to solve, describing the available dataset and the proposed solution. The experimental set-up, as well as the different set of experiments that have been carried out are described in Section \ref{sec:experiments}. Section \ref{sec:gp} shows the obtained results from the application of GP to security rules extraction and, finally, the conclusions of this work along with some suggestions about how to continue our research are given in Section \ref{sec:future}.

% (Paloma) To be extended

Since BYOD started to appear in companies' day-to-day policies  a lot
of research has been done about the advantages and disadvantages of
this approach \cite{singh2012byod}, as well as how to properly implement it in order to
respect privacy while trying to secure the resources \cite{scarfo2012new, ali2015analysis, de2015corporate}. % this is a

 Scarfo differentiates in \cite{scarfo2012new} two main ways to deal with the BYOD paradigm: allowing the device to connect via desktop or application virtualisation, meaning enough control to avoid employee's devices monitorisation; or control via Mobile Device Management (MDM), which has to be legally agreed with the employee. Ali et al. expand Scarfo's study in \cite{ali2015analysis} so that they review both BYOD access control models and BYOD security models. The authors further distinguish between MDM and Kernel Modifications inside the security models, and conclude with the description of a proposed model which combines most of the reviewed solutions, i.e. MDM and Virtual Private Network (VPN) access together with an encrypted container for the accessed information depending on the level of restriction. However, from all the papers in \cite{ali2015analysis} claimed to enforce policies, only in \cite{rhee2013high} the authors actually describe how the policies are enforced by describing which data is monitored. In any case, none of the papers mention the application of GP to the enforcement of the security policies, but other techniques such as the implementation of blacklists to avoid the installation of forbidden applications, or whitelists to allow only certain ones. These techniques can be useful with respect to the implementation of already defined security policies, but our method allows to discover new security policies, which in the case of black and white lists, can evolve them to include new and/or malicious applications.
 %Pablo: If previous papers describe some computational methods I would add to the last paragraph some of the techniques used. "...security policies, but other techniques such as ... These techniques can be useful with respect to... but our method is awesome because...".
 % (Paloma) I've included more information, please ckeck :D

From the point of view of market products, a variety of them have been released to help companies speed up the process of adoption of the BYOD concept. In \cite{de2015corporate} there is a description of the market solutions that the main manufacturers have developed to such purpose. The level of security and privacy preservation offered by these applications is different depending on the solution. 

With regard to the extracted data, which quality is necessary to ensure low rates of noise and accurate extracted knowledge, researchers have advanced the state of the art in the precision of the devices. For instance, in \cite{rios2015mobile}, the authors focus on the importance of having an accurate measure of the location of the devices. Although their approach seems to encroach upon employees' privacy, they implemented a mobile information system for BYOD adaptation and tested it in both Android and iOS devices. The authors concluded that the efficiency of their system, along with the possibilities of the hardware in the devices, results in a location error of less than 50 meters with a 95\% confidence level. These promising results allow the companies to use the location of their employees to apply certain security policies.  

To the best of our knowledge, there is not a tool that helps CSOs in developing new security rules via GP, even as this method has been indeed applied to classification -- from which classification rules can be obtained -- , as described by Espejo et al. in \cite{espejo2010survey}. Their work theoretically supports our decision of applying GP to obtain security rules in a BYOD environment. Furthermore, the works they review have applications in all fields but not exactly the one we focus on here. The authors studied three papers which use GP for classification with communications data, but mainly for intrusion detection and e-mail spamming. Also, in \cite{DeFalco2002257}, a system which discovers rules for the PROBEN1 databases via GP is described. As happened in the survey of Espejo et al., from the six databases inside PROBEN1 and analysed by these authors, none is related to security. In \cite{Tsakonas2004195} the authors also extract rules with \textsc{IF \ldots THEN} structure through GP, although for medical purposes.
%Pablo: link previous paragraph with next one. Also, I would not use "on the other hand" below as it is not clear which is the "first hand". For example: "... rules via GP, even as this method has been applied to classification..."
% (Paloma) Done, check please!

The lack of BYOD-related security databases is a hindrance for the proliferation of research in this field. As seen, there actually exist a number of datasets related to malware, e-mail spamming, or URL requests \footnote{http://www.secrepo.com/}, but none about the use that people make of their smartphones. This situation clearly exists due to privacy considerations. Miller et al. \cite{Miller201253} firmly state that the issue of privacy is even more important than the security issue, although it does not receive the same attention. Furthermore, when the MDM solution is described in \cite{ali2015analysis}, the authors mention the privacy concerns the employees may have due to the processing that the company makes over all their behavioural data. And even after anonymising the resulting dataset, one can still, in certain cases, identify a user of the company the data comes from by processing the data. If this principle cannot be guaranteed, the data should not be released \cite{boillat2014handbook}.
% TODO Pablo: I would explain here again the issue adding "This is the reason we can not release the dataset used in the experimental section, because our data includes..." BUT if we release it (issue #20), we can say that we are awesome and cool researchers by doing it
% (Paloma) Ok then I leave this as TODO once we decide if we can release it.

%Pablo: move this paragraph after the market product analysis. So, the SOA outline should be: 1) BYOD is a thing 2) There are some stuff done (market product, extracted data...) 3) However, in previous works there are stuff that SHOULD be done (GP and releasing datasets) for some fancy reasons, and 4) In this paper we do this and that to solve it.
% (Paloma) Re-organised, I think well, but check in case I didn't move it to where you suggested.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

As previously highlighted, the main idea behind the corporate security policies, which are defined by the CSO, is to build a basic, fixed, and well defined set of rules, in the form of \textsc{IF \ldots THEN} clauses,  by which the company system allows or denies access to the company assets. In this sense and while facing an attack from a BYOD system, the set of rules will be tested looking for a matching between the access' characteristics and the rules' premises (the IF variables part of all rules). If a matching is found then the decision can be made, by checking the conclusion part of the rule set (the THEN part), either by allowing or denying employees' access to non-confident or non-certified data for example. However, it is important to mention that the companies' security rule set defined by the CSO is based on known and previously recognized accesses and thus it cannot cover the whole possibly safe and risky search spaces. Therefore, there is an urgent need to create a more reliable rule set which is able to cover every new situation that may be a threat. Hence, allowing the system to go beyond the limited set of known pre-defined rules.

Our proposed solution is based on a novel GP framework dedicated for the BYOD context capable of performing an automatic and wider discovery of classification rules. More precisely, our GP based framework will, first, extract all the possible values of every attribute in the data at hand and then make the ``RuleGeneticAlgorithm'' evolving. Specifically, in this context, each individual is seen as a set of rules. The best individual is the set which rules covers the maximum patterns. The last step would be to present the rules to the CSO of the company and tune the algorithm according to the decision. The description of the used data and further explicit details about our proposed solution are given in what is next.

\subsection{Available Data}
\label{subsec:data}

Anonymised user data has been used to perform the experiments for this work. The set of data has been gathered from the trials that were performed during the development of an FP7 European Project, called MUSES \cite{DBLP:conf/sac/MoraCGZJEBAH14}. In these trials, a group of users tested an application meant for securing a BYOD environment. The application generates warnings when the users acts in a dangerous way. Technically, these warnings were triggered by a set of initial and pre-defined rules, so that when certain conditions were met in an ``event'', the corresponding action could be allowed - nothing happened - or denied where a warning appeared.

The dataset contains, thus, a set of these ``events'' from which a number of attributes have been extracted or are given by the application itself. Therefore, the attributes can be classified in different ways, and one of them is the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attributes given by the ``event detector'' in the application: These attributes are related to the type of the event (action), its timestamp, or origin, among others.
  \item Attributes inferred from the information in the database: The information given by the aforementioned attributes, along with the rest of information already existing in the database, helps inferring other attibutes.
      % (Zaineb) This sentence is weird. Please clarify it Paloma. I did not get what you mean here.
      % (Paloma) I hope it's more clear now
       These are, for instance: all information related to the origin, like the user position in the company or the device Operating System; the configuration of the device, such as WiFi or Bluetooth being enabled; and even lexical properties of the user password, in order to avoid storing the password itself or using it for classification or rule generation.
\end{itemize}

The trials had a duration of a month plus a week, and a total of 153270 events were registered in the database. It is important to note that from all of those events, almost 65\% were not useful for knowledge extraction purposes, as they were events of ``log in'', ``log out'', or ``restart''. The other 35\% were considered as \textit{important} because they contained information about user actions such as opening files or sending emails in a certain connection environment, changing security properties, or installing apps. Altogether, there are 38 attributes plus the class, which can take two possible values: GRANTED or STRONGDENY.

With respect to the balance between the classes, the dataset is unbalanced with the following ratio: 45856 instances are labelled as GRANTED and 3350 are labelled as STRONGDENY.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
\label{subsec:solution}
% (zaineb) I prefer adding a sentence here as an introduction. What do you think Paloma?
% (Paloma) I agree, but as Pablo didn't finish the section, I prefer to wait :)
The proposed method uses GP to create a tree to model the different rules. The generated tree
is a binary tree of expressions formed by two different types of nodes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Variable}: It is a logical expression formed by a name, an operator and a value. It is the equivalent to a ``primitive'' in the field of GP. \\
    Examples:
   \begin{math}
     \left \{
   \begin{array}{l}
     \texttt{password\_length<5} \\
     or \\
      \texttt{event\_level=>COMPLEX\_EVENT}
   \end{array}
   \right .
   \end{math}
\item {\em Action}: It is a leaf of the   tree and therefore, a ``terminal'' state. Each decision is the result of applying the rule; so it is limited to two terms which are \texttt{GRANTED} or \texttt{STRONGDENY}.
\end{itemize}

The different variables that have been used are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Binary Variable}: %TODO
\item {\em Categorical Variable}:
\item {\em Numerical Variable}:

\end{itemize}

The tree is translated to a set of rules starting from the leafs to the root node passing each time by the ancestors. An example of a rule can be presented as follows:
%TODO Show this more fancy :P (Pablo)

\begin{verbatim}
device_has_accessibility=false AND
wifiEnabled=false AND password_length<5 AND
wifiConnected=false AND
event_level=>COMPLEX_EVENT AND
user_role=>Administration AND
device_is_rooted=true THEN=STRONGDENY
\end{verbatim}


\section{Experiments Description}
\label{sec:experiments}

Sub-tree crossover and 1-node mutation evolutionary operators have been used, following our previous works that have used these operators obtaining good results \cite{EvoStar2014:GPBot}. In this case, the mutation randomly changes the complete variable of a node or mutate the complete value. Each configuration is executed 30 times, with a population of 32 individuals and a 2-tournament selector for a pool of 16 parents.
