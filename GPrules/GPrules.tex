\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The fast pace of new technology has led modern computing to undergo
several outstanding transitions in a short period of time. Modern
computing has moved over time to smaller, more reliable and faster
high-tech devices such as smartphones, laptops and tablets. The use of
these technologies in several forms is progressing, and has led to the
form of use known as the ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD) concept or
philosophy. % Definition of the concept should have a reference too - JJ
Since its first appearance in research
\cite{ballagas2004byod} as a way to call the interaction between
people's devices and a public display, such as art or advertising, it
has become a very popular practise, integrated into companies
\cite{thomson2012byod} and even schools \cite{song2014bring}.  

In the corporate world, the BYOD
practice refers to allowing employees to use their
personal laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices in
for work-related tasks, but not necessarily while being in the workplace This has many
advantages \cite{singh2012byod}; among them we mention saving costs --
as the company allows itself to save money on high-priced devices that
it would normally be required to purchase for their employees --, and
increasing flexibility and worker productivity as employees will not
be asked to haul around multiple devices to satisfy both their personal and
work needs, having everything they need in one device anytime and
anywhere. 
Other advantages are tied to the increase of worker satisfaction, attracting the best candidates, and the increase of engagement in the workplace and after hours \cite{singh2012byod}. 

%These advantages have made BYOD policies gain traction in the education
%sector with an increasing number of schools around the world choosing
%to implement their own BYOD policies. % reference!!! - JJ
% Also I don't see the point. Where do you want to bring this argument to? - JJ
% Ok, maybe we talk too much about BYOD at schools when we use company
% BYOD data, but it's true that schools are environments in which
% policies should be enforced too, right? Or can be applied in another
% way... So, what can we do? To create a section at the end called
% "other applications for our framework", for example? Or just mention
% it, reducing what's written now, and that's all?
% I would go for just mentioning it, because issues are much
% different. What company "assets" are we protecting here? - JJ
%In such environment, BYOD (also called Bring Your Own Technology) refers to a technology model that
%allows students to bring their own devices to school for learning in
%the classroom \cite{sangani2013byod, song2014bring}. The adoption of BYOD in schools
%is supported by the fact that technology plays a leading role in
%pupils/students' everyday lives and should, therefore, be an integral
%part of their learning. However, for most schools it is financially
%unsustainable to provide every student with the most appropriate
%up-to-date device. BYOD is therefore considered an attractive,
%cost-effective alternative, provided that many students usually own
%devices that are superior and more up-to-date than those available in
%schools. BYOD at schools has several benefits as well such as
%personalising learning experiences, encouraging students' independent
%learning, and promoting anytime, anywhere learning opportunities. % and this is important to know because... - JJ

However, there exists a big disadvantage concerning security, as
potentially unsecured devices from unaware users might interact with
important assets. Therefore, the main issue is to obtain a high level
of security, while maintaining user privacy \cite{miller2012byod}.
Focusing on the corporate world and as previously highlighted,
it is clear that the uncontrolled access to internal networks by the
personal devices, for which companies have limitations in
controlling due to privacy preservation \cite{miller2012byod}, exposes the companies to security risks such as data
leakage, improper decommissioning, phishing including spear phishing, surveillance, and many
others \cite{lennon2012changing}. These threats have become the
companies main security concern, and for them it is a challenge to
assure a compromise between pushing personal devices towards
professional use and coping with their own stringent and complex
security requirements. This trend is inevitable as enterprises are
faced with questions of whether and how to manage this situation \cite{thomson2012byod}; and
thus every department must be involved in establishing security
policies and procedures to minimize the company's risks.

To this end, the Corporate Security Policies (CSPs) \cite{Kaeo:2003:DNS:1201807}, 
defined by the company's Chief Security Officer (CSO) are the core at the
identification of threats and the construction of a set of security rules. The description of these jobs include protecting
company assets by defining permissions to be considered for every
different action to be performed inside or outside the company's work
space, and eventually coming from the employees personal
devices. Nonetheless, CSOs build the set of CSPs based on their
expertise, and as such, they have the limitation of not knowing every
possible combination of events that might lead to a dangerous
situation. 

The aim of this paper is to propose a novel technique for extracting
BYOD security rules that help the CSO in the definition and refinement
of a set of security rules, that in the end, classify an upcoming
event or user action as permitted or not permitted.
The main idea is to create a reliable rule set
which is able to cover every new situation that may be a threat;
allowing the system to go beyond the limited set of known pre-defined
rules. In order to have the space of possible policy rules be as wide
as possible, we will need a technique that explores the rule space
efficiently and with the least assumptions about rule structure.
This is why we have decided to use Genetic Programming (GP) for dealing with the problem of
discovering novel, interesting knowledge and rules from large
amounts of data \cite{freitas2002data}, given that the up-to-date approaches are based in general pre-defined of manually defined rules \cite{ali2015analysis}. Considered part of the so-called \emph{Evolutionary
  Algorithms} \cite{back1996evolutionary}, GP are optimization
techniques inspired by natural evolution. By this method, the
solutions to a problem are internally encoded as trees, which can be
seen as a decision tree classifier \cite{safavian1990survey}. In our case, the assigned classes, or leaves of the tree, would be ``allow'' or ``deny'', acting over a certain incoming event; whilst the nodes are the conditions that have to be met to apply the action. Taking this into account, GP can be used to generate these classification trees, optimising an objective function called {\em fitness}. The fitness can be defined as the accuracy of a rule, being this the most used metric in classification \cite{witten2005data}, along with the classification error. But since there are other metrics that influence ``how good'' a rule or a set of rules is, such as the depth of the created tree or the number of nodes it has \cite{back1996evolutionary}, it would be of convenience to use them in the definition of the fitness.
Our proposed GP framework dedicated
for the BYOD context is capable of performing an automatic discovery
of classification rules, maximising the fitness, and presenting the rules in a way that is helpful for a CSO.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section \ref{sec:SotA} we give an overview of the advances in GP applied to rule evolution and its applications; then, Section \ref{sec:problem} depicts the problem this work tries to solve, describing the available dataset and the proposed GP framework. The experimental set-up, as well as the different set of experiments that have been carried out are described in Section \ref{sec:experiments}. Section \ref{sec:gp} shows the obtained results from the application of GP to security rules extraction and, finally, the conclusions of this work along with some suggestions about how to continue our research are given in Section \ref{sec:future}.  

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:SotA}

Since BYOD policies started to appear in companies' day-to-day policies  a lot
of research has been done about the advantages and disadvantages of
this approach \cite{singh2012byod}, as well as about how to properly implement it in order to
respect privacy while trying to secure the resources \cite{scarfo2012new, ali2015analysis, de2015corporate}.
These issues can be approached in different ways; Scarfo
differentiates in \cite{scarfo2012new} two main ones: allowing the
device to connect via desktop or application virtualisation, meaning
enough control to avoid employee's devices monitorisation; or allowing
the company to control devices
via Mobile Device Management (MDM), which has to be legally agreed
with the employee. %Mention disadvantages: the company has to provide
                   %a virtualization platform and pay for cloud
                   %resources, or the employee has to allow the
                   %company to control its own device, which
                   %eventually dispels two of the advantages of BYOD
                   %policies: low overhead cost and preservation of
                   %privacy. (something like that). 
 Ali et al. expand from Scarfo's study in
\cite{ali2015analysis} reviewing both BYOD access control
 and security models. The authors further distinguish
between MDM and Kernel Modifications inside the security models, and
conclude with the description of a proposed model which combines most
of the reviewed solutions, i.e. MDM and Virtual Private Network (VPN)
access together with an encrypted container for the accessed
information depending on the level of restriction. However, from all
the papers in \cite{ali2015analysis} claimed to enforce policies, only
in \cite{rhee2013high} the authors actually describe how the policies
are enforced by describing which data is monitored. In any case, none
of the papers mention the application of GP to the enforcement of the
security policies, but other techniques such as the implementation of
blacklists to avoid the installation of forbidden applications, or
whitelists to allow only certain ones. These techniques can be useful
with respect to the implementation of already defined security
policies, but our method allows to discover new security policies,
which in the case of black and white lists, can evolve them to include
new and/or malicious applications. 

Research in BYOD has been accompanied by innovation in products released
to help companies implement or streamline the process of adoption of the BYOD
concept. In \cite{de2015corporate} there is a description of the
market solutions that the main manufacturers have developed to such
purpose. The level of security and privacy preservation offered by
these applications is different depending on the solution.
None of the reviewed solutions, but one, seem to offer a dynamic creation of rules in the database used for incident detection. The one called MUSES does implement rule inference and mentions the use of GP to perform this task. In this work we extend the description of the rule inference process, as well as the details of its implementation and the results after applying it to the data gathered with the very same MUSES application (see Section \ref{subsec:data}).


Previous papers have commented on the issue of using quality data to obtain accurate and valuable extracted knowledge, which is specially difficult when dealing with datasets taken from real world problems, where the sensors cannot work properly at a certain time. % or the data can present imbalance.
To avoid this, researchers have advanced the state of the art in the precision of the
devices. For instance, in \cite{rios2015mobile}, the authors focus on
the importance of having an accurate measure of the location of the
devices. Although their approach seems to encroach upon employees'
privacy, they implemented a mobile information system for BYOD
adaptation and tested it in both Android and iOS devices. The authors
concluded that the efficiency of their system, along with the
possibilities of the hardware in the devices, results in a location
error of less than 50 meters with a 95\% confidence level. These
promising results allow the companies to use the location of their
employees to apply certain security policies.

%Another barrier to obtain good quality knowledge discovering are datasets that present imbalance, because they normally bias the elaboration of classification rules or trees towards the majority class - the class with higher representation in the dataset - \cite{japkowicz2002class}. In this sense, solutions can be found in literature in order to reduce the bias while performing classification tasks, such as in \cite{chawla2005data} and \cite{sun2009classification}. However, as we have center our proposal in GP, we have studied Bhowan et al.'s work in \cite{bhowan2012developing}, where they present a comparison between many different types of fitness functions, testing on various unbalanced datasets, with different minority-class/majority-class ratios.

Even when a lot has been advanced in preprocessing techniques in order to work with quality and accurate data \cite{han2011data}, still there is room for research in the discovery of new rules from real world data. To the best of our knowledge, there is no tool that helps CSOs in
developing new security rules via GP, % But this is a very hard
                                % claim. It should go to the
                                % introduction!!! - JJ
                                % (Paloma) Will study this)
 even as this method has been
indeed applied to classification -- from which classification rules
can be obtained -- , as described by Espejo et al. in
\cite{espejo2010survey}. Their work theoretically supports our
decision of applying GP to obtain security rules in a BYOD
environment. Furthermore, the works they review have applications in
all fields but not exactly the one we focus on here. The authors
studied three papers which use GP for classification with
communications data, but mainly for intrusion detection and e-mail
spamming. Also, in \cite{DeFalco2002257}, a system which discovers
rules for the PROBEN1 databases via GP is described. As happened in
the survey of Espejo et al., from the six databases inside PROBEN1 and
analysed by these authors, none is related to security. In
\cite{Tsakonas2004195} the authors also extract rules with \textsc{IF
  \ldots THEN} structure through GP, although for medical purposes. Futhermore, Alex A. Freitas deeply studied the application of GP to Data Mining (DM) in \cite{freitas2002data}, providing the necessary knowledge and guidelines to design a GP framework for DM applications. Section \ref{subsec:solution} will describe in detail which solution has been built from what has been found in the work of Freitas.

%Once again, this paragraph does not follow the previous one. Maybe
%move it one paragraph up, where you are talking about proper training
%data. 
The lack of BYOD-related security databases is a hindrance for the
proliferation of research in this field. As seen, there actually exist
a number of datasets related to malware, e-mail spamming, or URL
requests \footnote{http://www.secrepo.com/}, but none about the use
that people make of their smartphones. This situation clearly exists
due to privacy considerations. Miller et al. \cite{Miller201253}
firmly state that the issue of privacy is even more important than the
security issue, although it does not receive the same
attention. Furthermore, when the MDM solution is described in
\cite{ali2015analysis}, the authors mention the privacy concerns the
employees may have due to the processing that the company makes over
all their behavioural data. And even after anonymising the resulting
dataset, one can still, in certain cases, identify a user of the
company the data comes from by processing the data. If this principle
cannot be guaranteed, the data should not be released
\cite{boillat2014handbook}. 

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

As previously highlighted, the main idea behind corporate security
policies, which are defined by the CSO, is to build a basic, fixed,
and well defined set of rules, which take the form of \textsc{IF
  \ldots THEN} clauses. By applying them the company system decides if certain conditions are met in order to allow or
deny access to an asset, whether is from the company or is accesed from it. % not only company assets. Also other
                                % assets _while_ on the company VPN or
                                % network - JJ
                                % (Paloma) better? 
Therefore, these rules can be visualized as the actions, taking place in a precise environment, being classified as
allowed or denied. In this sense and while facing a security breach
from a BYOD system, the set of rules will be tested looking for
matches between the access' characteristics and the rules' premises --
the conditions expressed in the IF part, also known as the description
of the rule \cite{DeFalco2002257}. If it matches then the decision can
be made, by checking the conclusion part of the rule, which comes
after the THEN and indicates the class \cite{DeFalco2002257}, either
by allowing or denying employees' access to non-confidential
 or non-certified data, for example. However, it is important to
 mention that the companies'  set of security rules defined by the CSO is
 based on known and previously recognised accesses and thus it cannot
 cover the whole, safe and unsafe, search spaces. Therefore,
 there is an urgent need to develop a system capable of discovering a
 more reliable rule set which should be able to cover every new
 situation that may be a threat. Hence, allowing the company security
 system to go beyond the limited set of known, pre-defined rules.  % This rather belong to the introduction - JJ
 % (Paloma) The whole paragraph?

Our proposed solution is based on a novel GP framework dedicated for
the BYOD context and capable of performing an automatic and wider discovery of classification rules. More precisely, our GP based framework will, first, extract all the possible values of every attribute in the data at hand and then make the ``RuleGeneticAlgorithm'' evolving. % (Paloma) Pablo, more fancy way of saying this?
Specifically, in this context, we have decided to follow the more
conventional approach in Genetic Algorithms, the Pittsburgh approach
\cite{freitas2002data}, meaning that each individual is seen as a set
of rules. The best individual is thus the set which rules covers the
maximum patterns. The last step would be to present the rules to the
CSO of the company and tune the algorithm according to the decision of
finally including or not the set of rules in the main security
policy. The description of the used data and further explicit details
about our proposed solution are given in what is next. % What is BYOD
                                % specific in this approach? What are
                                % you using from the BYOD context? - JJ

\subsection{Available Data}
\label{subsec:data}

We have used user data to perform the experiments for this
work but Anonymised, in the sense that from all the attributes extracted from the user actions, the username is not included as a variable to build rules with. % User data is not specific. What kind of data? - JJ
% (Paloma) Tried to extend it
 The set of data has been gathered from the trials that were performed
 during the development of an FP7 European Project, called MUSES
 \cite{DBLP:conf/sac/MoraCGZJEBAH14}. In these trials, a group of
 users tested a smartphone and PC application meant for securing a
 BYOD environment. The application generates warnings when the users
 acts in a dangerous way. Technically, these warnings are triggered by
 a set of initial and pre-defined rules, so that when certain
 conditions are met in an ``event'' (an action performed by a user),
 the corresponding action could be allowed - nothing happened - or
 denied, where a warning appears explaining the rule that the user did not comply with and how to perform the action in a more secure way or environment.
								% Are you going to validate those
                                % warnings? To use them in the
                                % training set?
                                % (Paloma) This I didn't get
                                % What is BYOD specific?
                                % about them? - JJ
                                % (Paloma) Tried to explain this

The dataset contains a set of these ``events'' from which a number of attributes (variables) have been extracted or are given by the application itself. The attributes can be classified in different ways; one of them is based on whether they are directly read from the application or inferred after processing the read data. Therefore, we distinguish between:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attributes given by the tested application: these attributes
    are related to the type of the event (action), its timestamp, or
    the application which originated the event, among others. 
  \item Attributes inferred from the information in the database: the information given by the aforementioned attributes, along with the rest of information already existing in the database, helps inferring other attibutes. These are, for instance: all extra information related to the origin, like the user position in the company or the device Operating System; the configuration of the device, such as WiFi or Bluetooth being enabled; and even lexical properties of the user password, in order to avoid storing the password itself or using it for classification or rule generation.
\end{itemize}
% A more interesting way of classifying them would be the fact that
% they are BYOD specific or not. All of the examples that you have
% mentioned do not seem to be BYOD specific. - JJ
% (Paloma) Agree, will do

The trials had a duration of a month plus a week, and a total of
153270 events were registered in the database. We filtered those events that did not imply access to assets, meaning that they were not useful for
knowledge extraction purposes, such as events of \textit{log in},
\textit{log out}, or \textit{restarting the server}. % alternative
                                % rephrasing: We filtered those events
                                % that didn't imply access to assets,
                                % such as... JJ
The remaining was a 35\% (53296 instances) of the total, and were considered as \textit{important}
because they did contain information about user actions such as
opening files or sending emails in a certain connection environment,
changing security properties, or installing apps. Altogether, there
are 38 attributes plus the class, which can take two possible values:
GRANTED or STRONGDENY. 

With respect to the balance between the classes, the dataset is
unbalanced with the following ratio: 49289 instances are labelled as
GRANTED and 4007 are labelled as STRONGDENY. 

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
\label{subsec:solution}
As previously highlighted, in this work we propose a system which is
able to process a set of user actions that have been allowed or denied
based on initial, simple rules, and discover new rules by exploring
the whole space of possible combinations among the attribute
values. The proposed method uses GP to create a tree to model the
different rules, given that the problem can be seen as a
classification one and therefore the model can be a decision tree
\cite{safavian1990survey}. Then, the generated tree is a binary tree
of expressions formed by two different types of nodes:
% What you are _actually_ doing is re-discovering the original simple
% rules. You have to justify in what way you are _generalizing_ from
% those simple rules - JJ

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Variable}: it is a logical expression formed by a name, an operator and a value. It is the equivalent to a ``primitive'' in the field of GP \cite{back1996evolutionary}.  \\
    Examples:
   \begin{math}
     \left \{
   \begin{array}{l}
     \texttt{password\_length<5} \\
     or \\
      \texttt{event\_level=>COMPLEX\_EVENT}
   \end{array}
   \right .
   \end{math}
\item {\em Action}: it is a leaf of the   tree and therefore, a ``terminal'' state. Each decision is the result of applying the rule, so it is limited to two terms which are \texttt{GRANTED} or \texttt{STRONGDENY}.
\end{itemize}

At the same time, the variables can be differentiated into three types, described as follows \cite{witten2005data}:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Binary Variable}: those with a boolean value, for instance, variables that are related with the device services switched on or off and important features such as the device having or not an antivirus installed.
\item {\em Categorical Variable}: the ones with nominal values, where it is defined a list with the possible values it may have, in order to randomly pick up one in the creation of the rules.
\item {\em Numerical Variable}: those with a numerical value, for which both maximum and minimum values are specified.

\end{itemize}

The tree is translated to a set of rules starting from the leafs to the root node passing each time by the ancestors. An example of a rule can be presented as follows:
%TODO Show this more fancy :P (Pablo)

\begin{verbatim}
device_has_antivirus=false AND
password_length<5 AND
user_role=>Administration OR
device_is_rooted=true THEN=STRONGDENY
\end{verbatim}

Rules presented in this way offer good readability which is key to understand the relation between the attributes and how the described situation may, or may not, be dangerous. In the example, the system would have inferred that an action from a device without antivirus, a short password, and rooted or belonging to an administration employee, should be denied.
% (Paloma) Shall we explain what a rooted device is?
% You should rather say what is the relationship between these rules
% and the original rules - JJ

With regard to the fitness, in the application of GP to classification
the most used metric to calculate it is the accuracy
\cite{espejo2010survey}. The accuracy is normally obtained as the
ratio of the correctly classified instances among the total of
instances. To this end, in \cite{witten2005data} the authors use the
concepts of true positive/negative and false positive/negative. The
first refer to the instances classified correctly, and the latter are
those instances that should be negative (positive) but are classified
as positive (negative), therefore they are false positives
(negatives). Using this nomenclature, a Fitness defined as the
accuracy or \textit{coverage} would be expressed as follows: 

% Saving this for later \cite{DeFalco2002257}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coverage}
f_{c} = TP + TN - (FP + FN)
\end{equation}

This kind of Fitness is used in maximisation problems, given that the ideal value of $f_{c}$ is the whole training dataset, $S_{tr}$. Additionally, to take into account the simplicity of the individuals, either they are a rule or a set of rules, in \cite{witten2005data} they introduce a measure of the generated trees complexity by this expression:

\begin{equation}
f_{s} = N_{nodes} + depth
\end{equation}

So that combining $f_{c}$, $f_{s}$ and introducing an $\alpha$ variable inside [0, 1] to tune up the degree of allowed complexity, the problem becomes now a matter of minimising this formula:

\section{Experiments Description}
\label{sec:experiments}

% This is not a description of the experiment. The experiment
% description is the set of steps needed to reproduce them - JJ
Sub-tree crossover and 1-node mutation evolutionary operators have
been used, following our previous works that have used these operators
obtaining good results \cite{EvoStar2014:GPBot}. In this case, the
mutation randomly changes the complete variable of a node or mutate
the complete value. Each configuration is executed 30 times, with a
population of 32 individuals and a 2-tournament selector for a pool of
16 parents.


Table \ref{tab:parameters} summarizes all the parameters used.

\begin{table}

The used framework is OSGiLiath, a service-oriented evolutionary
framework \cite{DBLP:journals/soco/Garcia-SanchezGCAG13}. The
