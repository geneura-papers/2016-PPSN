A new method for security rules extraction using Genetic Programming is presented.
Different fitness functions are compared in order to maximize the validation coverage.
Two representations of the individuals are compared to minimize the false positives.
The methodology is applied over real data from a Bring Your Own Device scenario.
Results show that readable rules can be obtained with least false positives/negatives.
