abstract = "Data mining deals with the problem of discovering novel and interesting knowledge from large amount of data. This problem is often performed heuristically when the extraction of patterns is difficult using standard query mechanisms or classical statistical methods. In this paper a genetic programming framework, capable of performing an automatic discovery of classification rules easily comprehensible by humans, is presented. A comparison with the results achieved by other techniques on a classical benchmark set is carried out. Furthermore, some of the obtained rules are shown and the most discriminating variables are evidenced. "

abstract = "SummaryObjective : To demonstrate and compare the application of different genetic programming (GP) based intelligent methodologies for the construction of rule-based systems in two medical domains: the diagnosis of aphasia's subtypes and the classification of pap-smear examinations. Material: Past data representing (a) successful diagnosis of aphasia's subtypes from collaborating medical experts through a free interview per patient, and (b) correctly classified smears (images of cells) by cyto-technologists, previously stained using the Papanicolaou method. Methods: Initially a hybrid approach is proposed, which combines standard genetic programming and heuristic hierarchical crisp rule-base construction. Then, genetic programming for the production of crisp rule based systems is attempted. Finally, another hybrid intelligent model is composed by a grammar driven genetic programming system for the generation of fuzzy rule-based systems. Results: Results denote the effectiveness of the proposed systems, while they are also compared for their efficiency, accuracy and comprehensibility, to those of an inductive machine learning approach as well as to those of a standard genetic programming symbolic expression approach. Conclusion: The proposed GP-based intelligent methodologies are able to produce accurate and comprehensible results for medical experts performing competitive to other intelligent approaches. The aim of the authors was the production of accurate but also sensible decision rules that could potentially help medical doctors to extract conclusions, even at the expense of a higher classification score achievement.
