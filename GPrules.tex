\begin{abstract}
The growth of personal devices in terms of variety and computational
abilities has given birth to a new concept in the corporate world
known as ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD).
% (Paloma) I don't think it is "new" anymore.
Within this concept,
employees are allowed to bring and work with their personal devices at
offices. Despite the BYOD's significant advantages such as reducing
business cost and increasing work productivity; the uncontrolled
access to internal networks by the personal devices, for which
enterprises have limitations in controlling, exposes the companies to
security threats such as leak of confidential data and access by
unauthorized users. To handle these inadequate countermeasures,
% (Paloma) I will look for another word which fits better here than "countermeasures", as by this word we are calling the threats "inadequate responses" (?)
 there
is a need for a means of detecting and controlling abnormal user
access by establishing a classification rules based policy. Thus, in
this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming (GP) based framework for
BYOD security. In this environment, GP is used as a promising approach
capable of performing an automatic discovery of novel and interesting
classification rules; seen as a novel BYOD security rules extraction
technique for detecting abnormal access. The simulation results and a
comparison with the results achieved by other techniques confirm the
viability, effectiveness and applicability of the GP approach to the
BYOD security context.

In \cite{DeFalco2002257}, a system which discovers rules for the PROBEN1 databases via GP is described. From the six databases inside PROBEN1 and analised by these authors, none is related to security.
In \cite{Tsakonas2004195} the authors also extract rules with \textit{if-then} structure through GP, for medical purposes.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

\subsection{Available Data}
\label{subsec:data}

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
\label{subsec:solution}

The proposed method uses GP to create a tree to model the different rules. The generated tree
is a binary tree of expressions formed by two different types of nodes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Variable}: a logical expression formed by a name, and operator, and a value. It is the equivalent to a ``primitive'' in the field of GP. Examples:\texttt{password_length<5} or \texttt{event_level=>COMPLEX_EVENT}.
\item {\em Action}: a leave of the the tree (therefore, a ``terminal''). Each decision is the result of applying the rule, so it is limite to \texttt{GRANTED} or \textt{STRONGDENY}.
\end{itemize}

The different variables have been used:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Binary Variable}: %TODO
\item {\em Categorical Variable}: 
\item {\em Numerical Variable}: 

\end{itemize}

The tree is translated to a set of rules starting from the leafs reading the ancestors to for each rule:

Example of a rule: %TODO Show this more fancy :P (Pablo)

\begin{verbatim}
device_has_accessibility=false AND wifiEnabled=false AND password_length<5 AND wifiConnected=false AND event_level=>COMPLEX_EVENT AND user_role=>Administration AND device_is_rooted=true THEN=STRONGDENY 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Experiments Description}
\label{sec:experiments}

Sub-tree crossover and 1-node mutation evolutionary operators have been used, following our previous works that have used these operators obtaining good results \cite{CITAR_AQUI_EVOSTAR14GPBOT}. In this case, the mutation randomly changes the complete variable of a node or mutate the complete value. Each configuration is executed 30 times, with a population of 32 individuals and a 2-tournament selector for a pool of 16 parents.


Table \ref{tab:parameters} summarizes all the parameters used.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
{\em Parameter Name} & {\em Value} \\\hline
Population size & 32 \\\hline
Crossover type & Sub-tree crossover \\ \hline
Crossover rate & 0.5\\ \hline
Mutation  & 1-node mutation\\ \hline

Selection & 2-tournament \\ \hline
Replacement & Generational with elitism\\ \hline
