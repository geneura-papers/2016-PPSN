\begin{abstract}
The growth of personal devices in terms of variety and computational
abilities has given birth to a new concept in the corporate world
known as ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD). Within this concept,
employees are allowed to bring and work with their personal devices at
offices. Despite the BYOD's significant advantages such as reducing
business cost and increasing work productivity; the uncontrolled
access of internal networks by the personal devices, for which
enterprises have limitations in controlling, exposes the companies to
security threats such as leak of confidential data and access by
unauthorized users. To handle these inadequate countermeasures, there
is a need for a means of detecting and controlling abnormal user
access by establishing a classification rules based policy. Thus, in
this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming (GP) based framework for
BYOD security. In this environment, GP is used as a promising approach
capable of performing an automatic discovery of novel and interesting
classification rules; seen as a novel BYOD security rules extraction
technique for detecting abnormal access. The simulation results and a
comparison with the results achieved by other techniques confirm the
viability, effectiveness and applicability of the GP approach to the
BYOD security context.
