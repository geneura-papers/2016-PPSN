\begin{abstract}
The growth in the number of personal devices in terms of variety and computational
abilities has given birth to a new concept in the corporate world
known as ``Bring Your Own Device'' (BYOD).
% (Paloma) I don't think it is "new" anymore.
Within this concept,
employees are allowed to bring and work with their personal devices at
offices. Despite the BYOD's significant advantages such as reducing
business cost and increasing work productivity; the uncontrolled
access to internal networks by the personal devices, for which
enterprises have limitations in controlling, exposes the companies to
security threats such as leak of confidential data and access by
unauthorized users. To handle these inadequate countermeasures,
% (Paloma) I will look for another word which fits better here than "countermeasures", as by this word we are calling the threats "inadequate responses" (?)
 there
is a need for a means of detecting and controlling abnormal user
access by establishing a classification rules based policy. Thus, in
this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming (GP) based framework for
BYOD security. In this environment, GP is used as a promising approach
capable of performing an automatic discovery of novel and interesting
classification rules; seen as a novel BYOD security rules extraction
technique for detecting abnormal access. The simulation results and a
comparison with the results achieved by other techniques confirm the
viability, effectiveness and applicability of the GP approach to the
BYOD security context.

In \cite{DeFalco2002257}, a system which discovers rules for the PROBEN1 databases via GP is described. From the six databases inside PROBEN1 and analised by these authors, none is related to security.
In \cite{Tsakonas2004195} the authors also extract rules with \textit{if-then} structure through GP, for medical purposes.

\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

As previously highlighted, the BYOD paradigm has several advantages in
the corporate world as it plays a leading role in increasing the
companies benefits. This is achieved by allowing employees working
with their own personal devices in and out of corporate
environments. The benefits of BYOD are several; despite of that this
paradigm calls for a crucial need for securing the BYOD context. It is
clear that the uncontrolled access to internal networks by the
personal owned devices, for which companies have limitations in
controlling, exposes the companies to security risks such as data
leakage, improper decommissioning, phishing, surveillance, and many
others \cite{lennon2012changing}. These threats have become the
companies security concerns and for companies it is a challenge to
assure a compromise between pushing personal devices towards
professional use and coping with their own stringent and complex
security requirements. This trend is inevitable as enterprises are
faced with questions of whether and how to manage this situation; and
thus every department must be involved in establishing security
policies and procedures to minimize the company's risks. In the
corporate world environment, the Corporate Security Policies (CSPs),
defined by the company's Chief Security Officer (CSO), are the core at
identifying and building a set of security rules. These aim at protecting
company assets by defining permissions to be considered for every
different action to be performed inside or outside the company's work
space. %using eventually the employees personal devices.
The main idea
behind these CSPs is to build a basic, fixed and well defined set of
rules by which the company system allows or denies access to the
company assets. In this sense and while facing a pending % (Paloma) I've never heard about this expression, what does it mean?
from a BYOD 
system, the set of rules will be tested looking for a matching between
the access' characteristics and the rules' premises (the If variables
parts). If a matching is found then the decision can be made either by
allowing or denying employees' access to non-confident or
non-certified data for example. Yet, it is important to mention that
the companies' security rule set defined by the CSO is based on known, previously recognised,
accesses and thus it cannot cover the whole possibly safe and risky
search spaces. 

The aim of this paper is going beyond this traditional and simple
decision making process where a novel  BYOD security rules extraction
technique is proposed. The main idea is to create a reliable rule set
which is able to cover every new situation that may be a threat;
allowing the system to go beyond the limited set of known pre-defined
rules. This is achieved via the use of Genetic Programming (GP) which
has been emerged as a promising approach to deal with the problem of
discovering novel and interesting knowledge and rules from large
amount of data. Our proposed genetic programming framework dedicated
for the BYOD context is capable of performing an automatic discovery
of classification rules. More precisely, the GP based framework will,
first, extract all the possible values of every attribute in the data
at hand and then make the ``ruleGeneticAlgorithm''
evolving. Specifically, in this context, each individual is seen as a
set of rules. The best individual is the set which rules covers the
maximum patterns. The last step would be to present the rules to the
CSO of the company and tune the algorithm according to the decision. 

% We have to talk about the data!

\subsection{Available Data}
\label{subsec:data}

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
\label{subsec:solution}

The proposed method uses GP to create a tree to model the different rules. The generated tree
is a binary tree of expressions formed by two different types of nodes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Variable}: a logical expression formed by a name, and operator, and a value. It is the equivalent to a ``primitive'' in the field of GP. Examples:\texttt{password\_length<5} or \texttt{event\_level=>COMPLEX\_EVENT}.
\item {\em Action}: a leave of the the tree (therefore, a ``terminal''). Each decision is the result of applying the rule, so it is limite to \texttt{GRANTED} or \texttt{STRONGDENY}.
\end{itemize}

The different variables have been used:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Binary Variable}: %TODO
\item {\em Categorical Variable}: 
\item {\em Numerical Variable}: 

\end{itemize}

The tree is translated to a set of rules starting from the leafs reading the ancestors to for each rule:

Example of a rule: %TODO Show this more fancy :P (Pablo)

\begin{verbatim}
device_has_accessibility=false AND wifiEnabled=false AND 
password_length<5 AND wifiConnected=false AND
event_level=>COMPLEX_EVENT AND user_role=>Administration AND
device_is_rooted=true THEN=STRONGDENY 
\end{verbatim}

\section{Experiments Description}
\label{sec:experiments}

Sub-tree crossover and 1-node mutation evolutionary operators have been used, following our previous works that have used these operators obtaining good results \cite{CITAR_AQUI_EVOSTAR14GPBOT}. In this case, the mutation randomly changes the complete variable of a node or mutate the complete value. Each configuration is executed 30 times, with a population of 32 individuals and a 2-tournament selector for a pool of 16 parents.


Table \ref{tab:parameters} summarizes all the parameters used.
